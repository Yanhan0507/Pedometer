Yanhan Zhang

### Overview
Basically, it is a android application which can count the number of steps accurately. You can see the source code in src file.
Also, by importing the code to Android Studio or Eclipse IDE, you will be able to run this code in your Android Virtue Machine/
Android Smartphone.

### Things to notice
The .csv file is irrelevant to the implementation. Actually, it is a file that store the data we collect from cell phone sensor(
Accelerometer). We used this data to analyze the noise type, and test the algorithm. Feel free to delete these .csv files, if you want.
